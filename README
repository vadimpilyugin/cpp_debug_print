A simple library for debug output in console.
Just include printer.h, you don't have to link it.
Features:
- 5 different output messages: debug, assert, note, error and fatal
- Each message has its own color: for example, debug messages are green
- Two exception types: FatalException and AssertException. If assertion was failed
  then an exception is raised. FatalException is raised whenever a fatal() method is called.
